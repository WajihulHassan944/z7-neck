              By using the Z7 as a teaching tool, coaches can stress the need
              for neck protection during drills. Even amid erratic play, parents
              will value knowing their kid is safer on the field. Emphasizing
              safety helps teams to trust one another and motivates athletes to
              speak out if something seems wrong. Though petite, it can have
              significant consequences both physically and mentally.
